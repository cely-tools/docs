## Overview
Cely's goal is to add a login system into your app in under 30 seconds!

### Background
Whether you're building an app for a client or for a hackathon, building a login system, no matter how basic it is, can be very tedious and time-consuming. Cely's architecture has been battle tested on countless apps, and Cely guarantees you a fully functional login system in a fraction of the time. You can trust Cely is handling login credentials correctly as well since Cely is built on top of [Locksmith](https://github.com/matthewpalmer/Locksmith), swift's most popular Keychain wrapper.

#### Details:
What does Cely does for you?

1. Simple API to store user creditials and information **securely**
 - `Cely.save("SUPER_SECRET_STRING", forKey: "token", securely: true)`
2. Manages switching between your app's Home Screen and Login Screen with:
 - `Cely.changeStatus(to: .loggedIn) // or .loggedOut`
3. Customizable starter Login screen(or you can use your login screen)

What Cely **does not do** for you?

1. Network requests
2. Handle Network errors
3. Anything with the network

(has read _I want to add single user basic authentication_)
(has read _understanding keychain_)

Read wants to learn:

- settings toggle for `enable FaceID`
  - turned on "we get credentials and resave with faceId flag"
  - turned off "we get credentials and resave without faceId flag"
- This is for more secure apps (bank apps, enterprise app)
- handle splash screen
- Add FaceID Authentication (with allowableReuseDuration)
  - Require FaceID authentication every time
- adding plist key
